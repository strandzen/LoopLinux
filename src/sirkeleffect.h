// Loop-style directional window snapping. Hold the hyperkey (Caps Lock,
// remapped to F24 by keyd) to arm the effect, move the mouse (or press an
// arrow key) to pick a direction, release to snap the active window on its
// own screen.
//
// Activation is a single global shortcut (F24 press) handled the ordinary
// KWin-effect way via KGlobalAccel. Everything from press to release is then
// driven by an exclusive keyboard grab + pointer interception
// (effects->grabKeyboard / startMouseInterception).
//
// Visuals are a single plain QQuickWindow (m_overlay, loading Overlay.qml,
// which hosts both the outline preview and the indicator as two Items in
// one scene — see Overlay.qml for why this is one window and not two), not
// a QuickSceneEffect scene. KWin runs its own UI (decorations, tooltips, the
// task switcher) as ordinary internal QQuickWindows composited through the
// normal per-window path, which supports real alpha blending — unlike
// QuickSceneEffect, whose backing surface is always opaque (confirmed live:
// a Window.color="transparent" binding had zero visible effect there).
// Using plain QQuickWindow here is standard public Qt API, not a KWin-
// specific mechanism, so it carries no linking/ABI risk.
