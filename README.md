# Sirkel

A [Loop](https://github.com/MrKai77/Loop)-inspired directional window snapping tool for KDE Plasma 6.7+ / KWin.

Hold a hyperkey (Caps Lock, remapped to F24), drag the mouse or press a direction key to pick where the active window should go, release to snap it there - left/right halves, top/bottom halves, or one of the four quarter corners, previewed live with an on-screen outline and a direction indicator.

## Features

- Hold-and-drag or hold-and-press-a-key directional snapping to 8 positions (halves + corners), with live outline and indicator previews
- Direction selection is sticky - once picked, relaxing the mouse or releasing the keys doesn't cancel it; only picking a different direction changes it
- Holding the hyperkey alone does nothing - the indicator only appears once you actually move the mouse or press a direction key, so a reflexive tap never triggers anything
- Resting the cursor at the indicator's own center maximizes the window instead - a live zone just like the other 8 directions, with its own padding applied
- Arrow keys, WASD, or HJKL for direction (configurable preset), including combining two keys (e.g. Up+Left) for a corner - or disable direction keys entirely for mouse-only use
- Hyperkey+Enter maximizes, Hyperkey+Backspace minimizes
- Esc, or releasing with no direction chosen, cancels cleanly
- Extensive, tabbed settings page (System Settings → Desktop Effects → Sirkel): Behavior, Indicator, Outline, and Colors each on their own tab

## Requirements

- KDE Plasma 6.7+ (KWin with the Wayland session)
- [keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd) - hard dependency, used to remap Caps Lock to F24 at the input level
- Build dependencies: CMake, Extra CMake Modules (ECM), Qt6 (Core, Gui, Qml, Quick, DBus), KDE Frameworks 6 (Config, CoreAddons, GlobalAccel, KCMUtils), and KWin's own development headers

## Installation

### 1. Configure keyd

Create `/etc/keyd/default.conf`:

```ini
[ids]

*

[main]

capslock = f24
```

Then enable and start the service:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now keyd
```

This dedicates Caps Lock entirely to acting as the hyperkey.

### 2. Build and install the plugin

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
sudo cmake --install .
```

This installs both the KWin effect itself and its System Settings configuration page.

### 3. Enable the effect

Open **System Settings → Desktop Effects**, find **Sirkel**, and enable it.

## Usage

1. Hold Caps Lock (F24).
2. Move the mouse toward an edge or corner, or press an arrow key (or WASD/HJKL, depending on the configured scheme) - the direction indicator and a preview outline show the current pick.
3. Release Caps Lock to snap the active window there, on its own screen (windows never move across monitors).

While held:
- **Enter**, or resting the cursor at the indicator's own center - maximize
- **Backspace** - minimize
- **Esc**, or releasing with no direction picked - cancel without moving the window

## Configuration

All settings live in **System Settings → Desktop Effects → Sirkel** (the configure/gear icon next to the effect), across four tabs:
- **Behavior** - mouse deadzone (horizontal/vertical), window padding, keybind scheme (arrows/WASD/HJKL/none)
- **Indicator** - visibility, spawn-at-cursor vs. centered, size, corner radius, ring thickness, pointer length, text label
- **Outline** - visibility, border thickness, corner radius, fill opacity, glide/grow animation speed
- **Colors** - a custom color picker (hex, or individual R/G/B/A sliders) plus quick-pick swatches sourced live from the current Plasma color scheme

Settings changes take effect automatically the next time you hold the hyperkey - no need to log out or restart the effect.

## Known limitations

- Only one window is placed at a time - no multi-window "thirds" layouts yet
- Keybind schemes are fixed presets (arrows / WASD / HJKL / none), not arbitrary rebinding
- Snapping doesn't move a window to a different monitor

## Comparison with Loop

How Sirkel stacks up against [Loop](https://github.com/MrKai77/Loop), the macOS app it's inspired by.

| Feature | Loop | Sirkel |
|---|---|---|
| Radial menu (hold key, drag mouse, release to snap) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Preview window before committing | ✅ | ✅ |
| Modifier + arrow keys | ✅ | ✅ |
| Modifier + mouse | ✅ | ✅ |
| Halves & quarters | ✅ | ✅ |
| Padding/margins | ✅ | ✅ |
| Radial menu theming (width/shape/color) | ✅ | ✅  |
| Preview theming (padding, corner radius, border color/width) | ✅ | ✅ 
| Indicator/preview independently toggleable | ✅ | ✅ |
| Maximize / center gesture | ✅ | ⏳ |
| Thirds (horizontal/vertical, two-thirds variants) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Per-action custom keybinds (any key → any specific action) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Cycles (repeated press/click cycles through size variants) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Stash (hide windows at screen edge, reveal on hover) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Granular manipulation (Larger/Smaller, Grow/Shrink per edge, nudge) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Undo last action | ✅ | ❌ |
| Restore initial frame (snap back to pre-Sirkel geometry) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Screen switching (move window to an adjacent monitor) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Almost Maximize / Centre as distinct actions | ✅ | ❌ |
| Snap via drag-to-edge (no hyperkey needed) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Separate colors for indicator vs. outline | ✅  | ❌ |

## Roadmap

- **Custom keybinds** - real per-action global shortcuts via `System Settings → Shortcuts` (maximize, minimize, each directional snap, and more), replacing the current fixed arrows/WASD/HJKL preset dropdown
- **Thirds** - horizontal and vertical third/two-thirds placements, not just halves and quarters
- **Cycles** - repeatedly pressing/clicking the same direction cycles the window through a small set of size variants (e.g. half → two-thirds → third) instead of re-picking the same geometry
- **Screen switching** - move the active window to an adjacent monitor
